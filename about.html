  <!-- Mission & Impact -->
  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Hayimi Movement is a grassroots initiative rooted in Ethiopia, committed to empowering communities through education, health, and humanitarian support. We believe in the power of local leadership, cultural preservation, and inclusive development.</p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p><strong>üíõ Supporting Internally Displaced People and Those with Disabilities:</strong> We‚Äôve witnessed the compassion of people from Ethiopia, North America, and beyond. Communities in crisis are not just seeking aid‚Äîthey‚Äôre seeking connection. We stand with them, knowing that healing and hope are reciprocal.</p>

    <p><strong>üç≤ Essential Food Support:</strong> We assist families facing critical needs by providing life-sustaining food packages, ensuring no one goes hungry during times of hardship.</p>

    <p><strong>üìö Educational Materials for Children:</strong> In regions affected by conflict and poverty, academic dreams are often disrupted. We respond by equipping children with school supplies and learning accessories, restoring their right to education.</p>

    <p><strong>üíä Life-Saving Medications:</strong> In conflict-ridden areas, access to medication is a matter of survival. We work to deliver essential drugs for chronic conditions like diabetes, hypertension, HIV/AIDS, and more‚Äîbecause every life deserves a fighting chance.</p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>We envision a future where every child learns freely, every family thrives with dignity, and every community rises with strength. Hayimi Movement is more than a name‚Äîit‚Äôs a promise to uplift, empower, and transform lives.</p>
